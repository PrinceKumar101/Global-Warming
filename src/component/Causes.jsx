              The climate on Earth has been changing since it formed 4.5 billion
              years
              <br /> ago. Until recently, natural factors have been the cause of
              these <br />
              changes. Natural influences on the climate include volcanic
              eruptions, <br />

              temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By burning fossil

              At the root of climate change is the phenomenon known as the
              greenhouse effect.
              <br />
              Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and stop it
              escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These
              gases&nbsp;act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the
              'greenhouse effect'.
              <br />
              Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources. Gases
              like
              <br /> carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur
              in the <br />
              atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only{" "}
              <br />
              produced by human activity.
              <br />
              When short-wave&nbsp;radiation from the sun reaches Earth, most of
              it <br />
              passes straight through and hits the surface. The Earth absorbs
              most of <br />
              this radiation and gives off longer-wavelength infrared radiation.
              <br />
              The greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation,
              instead <br />
              of it passing straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits{" "}
              <br />
              radiation in all directions, sending some of it back to the
              surface, <br />
              causing the planet to heat up. This process is known as the
              'greenhouse <br />
              effect'.
              <br />
              Since the Industrial Revolution, we've been adding more and more{" "}
              <br />
              greenhouse gases into the air, trapping even more heat. Instead of{" "}
              <br />
              keeping Earth at a warm, stable temperature, the greenhouse effect
              is <br />
              heating the planet at a much faster rate. We call this the
              'enhanced <br />
              greenhouse effect'&nbsp;and it's the main cause of climate change.

              Some amount of climate change can be attributed to natural
              phenomena. Over the course of Earth’s existence,{" "}
              <span style={{ color: "rgb(6, 0, 3)" }}>volcanic eruptions</span>,
              fluctuations in solar radiations, tectonic shifts, and even small
              changes in our orbit&nbsp;have all had observable effects on
              planetary warming and cooling patterns.
              <br />
              Natural cycles can cause the climate to alternate between warming
              and cooling. There are also natural factors that force the climate
              to change, known as 'forcings'. <br />
              <br />
              Some of these natural cycles include:
              <br />
              <strong>1. Milankovitch cycles</strong> – As Earth travels around
              the sun, its path and the tilt of its axis can change slightly.
              These changes, called Milankovitch cycles, affect the amount of
              sunlight that falls on Earth. This can cause the temperature of
              Earth to change. <br />
              However, these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of
              thousands of <br />
              years and are unlikely to be causing the changes to the climate
              that we <br />
              are seeing today.
              <br />
              <strong>2. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</strong> – ENSO is
              a pattern of changing water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. In
              an 'El Niño' year, the global temperature warms up, and in a 'La
              Niña' year, it cools down. These patterns can affect the global
              temperature for a short amount of time (months or years) but
              cannot explain the persistent warming that we see today.

              Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of what

              worldwide. &nbsp;The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the

              increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most
              notably carbon dioxide.

            <p>
              <strong>Transportation</strong>
              <br />
              The cars, trucks, ships, and planes that we use to transport
              ourselves and our goods are a major source of global greenhouse
              gas emissions.&nbsp;Burning petroleum-based fuel in combustion
              engines releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the
              atmosphere. <br />
              Passenger cars account for 41 percent of those emissions, with the
              typical passenger vehicle emitting about 4.6 metric tones of
              carbon dioxide per year.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Generating power</strong>
              <br /> Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels
              causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is
              still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas, which produces
              carbon dioxide and nitrous <br />
              oxide – powerful greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap
              the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of electricity
              comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources which, as
              opposed to fossil
              <br /> fuels, emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants
              into the air.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Cutting down forests</strong>
              <br />
              Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other
              reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release
              the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12
              million hectares of forest are destroyed. Since forests absorb
              carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to
              keep emissions out of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with
              agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for roughly
              a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Agriculture</strong>
              <br />
              The advent of modern, industrialized agriculture&nbsp;has
              significantly altered the vital but delicate relationship
              <br /> between soil and the climate. This sector is especially
              notorious for giving off large amounts of nitrous oxide and
              methane, powerful gases that are highly effective at trapping
              heat. The widespread adoption of chemical fertilizers, combined
              with certain crop-management practices that prioritize high yields
              over soil health, means that agriculture accounts for nearly
              three-quarters of the nitrous oxide found in our atmosphere.
              Meanwhile, large-scale industrialized livestock production
              continues to be a significant source of atmospheric methane, which
              is emitted as a function of the digestive processes of cattle and
              other ruminants.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Oil and gas development</strong>
              <br />
              Oil and gas lead to emissions at every stage of their production
              and consumption—not only when they’re burned as fuel, but just as
              soon as we drill a hole in the ground to begin extracting them.
              Fossil fuel&nbsp;development is a major source of methane, which
              invariably leaks from oil and gas operations: drilling, fracking,
              transporting, and refining. And while methane isn’t as prevalent a
              greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, it’s many times more potent at
              trapping heat during the first 20 years of its release into the{" "}
              <br />
              atmosphere. Even abandoned and inoperative wells—sometimes known
              as "orphaned" wells—leak
              <br /> methane. More than 3 million of these old, defunct wells
              are spread across the country and were responsible for emitting
              more than 280,000 metric tons of methane in 2018.
