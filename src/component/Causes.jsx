                The climate on Earth has been changing since it formed 4.5
                billion years ago. Until recently, natural factors have been the
                cause of these changes. Natural influences on the climate
                include volcanic eruptions, changes in the orbit of the Earth,
                and shifts in the Earth's crust (known as plate tectonics).
                However, since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, the
                global temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By
                burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, human
                activity has quickly become the leading cause of changes to our
                climate.

                At the root of climate change is the phenomenon known as the
                greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap
                heat and stop it escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse
                gases'. These gases&nbsp;act as a warming blanket around the
                Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'. Greenhouse gases come
                from both human and natural sources. Gases like carbon dioxide,
                methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the atmosphere.
                Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only produced by
                human activity. When short-wave&nbsp;radiation from the sun
                reaches Earth, most of it passes straight through and hits the
                surface. The Earth absorbs most of this radiation and gives off
                longer-wavelength infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases
                absorb some of this infrared radiation, instead of it passing
                straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits radiation in
                all directions, sending some of it back to the surface, causing
                the planet to heat up. This process is known as the 'greenhouse
                effect'. Since the Industrial Revolution, we've been adding more
                and more greenhouse gases into the air, trapping even more heat.
                Instead of keeping Earth at a warm, stable temperature, the
                greenhouse effect is heating the planet at a much faster rate.
                We call this the 'enhanced greenhouse effect'&nbsp;and it's the
                main cause of climate change.

                Some amount of climate change can be attributed to natural
                phenomena. Over the course of Earth’s existence, volcanic
                eruptions , fluctuations in solar radiations, tectonic shifts,
                and even small changes in our orbit have all had observable
                effects on planetary warming and cooling patterns. Natural
                cycles can cause the climate to alternate between warming and
                cooling. There are also natural factors that force the climate
                to change, known as 'forcings'.
                <br />
                Some of these natural cycles include:

                – As Earth travels around the sun, its path and the tilt of its
                axis can change slightly. These changes, called Milankovitch
                cycles, affect the amount of sunlight that falls on Earth. This
                can cause the temperature of Earth to change. However, these
                cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years
                and are unlikely to be causing the changes to the climate that
                we are seeing today.

                  Scientists agree that human activity is the primary driver of
                  what we’re seeing now <br />
                  worldwide. &nbsp;The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over
                  the past 150 years has drastically <br />
                  increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most
                  notably carbon dioxide.

                  The cars, trucks, ships, and planes that we use to transport
                  ourselves and our goods are a major source of global
                  greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;Burning petroleum-based fuel in
                  combustion engines releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide
                  into the atmosphere. <br />
                  Passenger cars account for 41 percent of those emissions, with
                  the typical passenger vehicle emitting about 4.6 metric tones
                  of carbon dioxide per year.

                    <br /> Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil
                    fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most
                    electricity is still generated by burning coal, oil, or gas,
                    which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous <br />

                    trap the sun’s heat. Globally, a bit more than a quarter of
                    electricity comes from wind, solar and other renewable
                    sources which, as opposed to fossil
                    <br /> fuels, emit little to no greenhouse gases or

                  <strong>Cutting down forests</strong>
                  <br />
                  Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other
                  reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut,
                  release the carbon they have been storing. Each year
                  approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed.
                  Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also
                  limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the
                  atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other
                  land use changes, is responsible for roughly a quarter of
                  global greenhouse gas emissions.

                  <strong>Agriculture</strong>
                  <br />
                  The advent of modern, industrialized agriculture&nbsp;has
                  significantly altered the vital but delicate relationship
                  <br /> between soil and the climate. This sector is especially
                  notorious for giving off large amounts of nitrous oxide and
                  methane, powerful gases that are highly effective at trapping
                  heat. The widespread adoption of chemical fertilizers,
                  combined with certain crop-management practices that
                  prioritize high yields over soil health, means that
                  agriculture accounts for nearly three-quarters of the nitrous
                  oxide found in our atmosphere. Meanwhile, large-scale
                  industrialized livestock production continues to be a
                  significant source of atmospheric methane, which is emitted as
                  a function of the digestive processes of cattle and other
                  ruminants.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Oil and gas development</strong>
                  <br />
                  Oil and gas lead to emissions at every stage of their
                  production and consumption—not only when they’re burned as
                  fuel, but just as soon as we drill a hole in the ground to
                  begin extracting them. Fossil fuel&nbsp;development is a major
                  source of methane, which invariably leaks from oil and gas
                  operations: drilling, fracking, transporting, and refining.
                  And while methane isn’t as prevalent a greenhouse gas as
                  carbon dioxide, it’s many times more potent at trapping heat
                  during the first 20 years of its release into the <br />
                  atmosphere. Even abandoned and inoperative wells—sometimes
                  known as "orphaned" wells—leak
                  <br /> methane. More than 3 million of these old, defunct
                  wells are spread across the country and were responsible for
                  emitting more than 280,000 metric tons of methane in 2018.
