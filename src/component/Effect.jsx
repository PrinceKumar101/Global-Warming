          Our climate is determined by patterns of temperature, wind,
          atmospheric pressure, humidity and rain over a long period of time.{" "}
          <br />
          There are different climates around the world, such as tropical, dry
          and moderate. As a large country, Australia has a variety of climates.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          The climate of an area determines its seasons and when they come and
          go. This, in turn, affects the type of plants that grow and which
          animals <br />
          survive. The species and places we love depend on intricate
          ecosystems, and even small changes to the climate can disrupt the
          delicate balance <br />
          of nature.
          <br />
          <br />
          As humans, every aspect of our life is reliant on the natural
          environment. This includes the food we eat, the air we breathe, the
          water we drink, the clothes we wear and the products that are made and
          old to create jobs and drive the economy. <br />
          <br />A healthy and stable climate is our most precious natural
          resource.

          2015 was the hottest year on record, the previous record was broken in
          2014, and 2016 is expected to set a new record for the third year in a
          row. In the past few years records have being broken for longest

          Increased ocean temperatures are melting glaciers and ice caps all
          over the world. Melted ice increases the volume of water in our
          oceans. Warmer temperatures also result in the expansion of the
          water's mass, which causes sea levels to rise, threatening low-lying
          islands and coastal cities.

          Extreme weather events like bushfires, cyclones, droughts and floods

          warming. &nbsp; <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          The oceans have absorbed most of extra heat and carbon dioxide (CO
          <sub>2</sub>) so far – more than the air – making the seas both warmer
          and more acidic. Warming waters are bleaching coral reefs and driving
          stronger storms. Rising ocean acidity threatens shellfish, including
          the tiny crustaceans without which marine food chains would collapse.

          Global warming stresses ecosystems through temperature rises, water
          shortages, increased fire threats, drought, weed and pest invasions,
          intense storm damage and salt invasion, just to name a few. Some of

          plants, animals and birds confronted with climate change have two
          options: move or adapt. With the speed of climate change we are
          experiencing already, it’s often not possible for a species to adapt
          quickly enough to keep up with its changing environment. And with the
          amount of habitat destruction, moving is becoming increasingly
          difficult. &nbsp; <br />

          Changes to rainfall patterns, increasingly severe drought, more
          frequent heat waves, flooding and extreme weather make it more
          difficult for farmers to graze livestock and grow produce, reducing

          Rising sea levels and more frequent and intense storm surges will see
